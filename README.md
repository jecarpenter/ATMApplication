I used GPT to speed up the process of generating API health checks in the ATMApplication.http file.
I also used it to assist with the readme formatting and cleanliness.
For the sake of catching edge cases without the assistance of QA and with minimal time to test, I fed some of the service methods into GPT to catch edge cases and ensure stability.
It was also used sparsely in troubleshooting, and refactoring code in numerous portions of the application.
